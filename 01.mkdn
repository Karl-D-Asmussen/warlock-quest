I hide under my blankets while mom goes with the strange man in the room upstairs. The bar maid
looks at me with pity.

"Do you want a bowl of stew?" she asks.

I nod. Last I ate was yesterday. My tail swishes back and forth with exitement.

"Martha, what are you doing?"

"Giving the little girl a hearty meal; look at her!"

"She's a tiefling!"

"And my grandmother was an Orc, what is your point?"

----

"Stupid devilfucking bitch."

Mom lies on the ground. She isn't moving anymore. The henchmen --- Pawpaw's thugs --- drag me away. I should be screaming.

"At least this one is nice and docile..."

"Don't lay a hand on her."

"Why? She's a half-devil, innit? Nobody minds!"

"Yeah, but we can make a pretty penny on a fucking _white-skinned tiefling,_ you trogdolyte!"

----

He's in his mid forties. Handsome, for someone who probably spends most of his time reading. A real wizard.
I can see it in his eyes: I'm not a person to him.

"She'll do," he says.

"That'll be a long hundred," Pawpaw says.

Wordlessly, he forks over a hefty purse. "What's your name, girl?"

"Jacaranda," I mutter.

----

The following month(? Year? Decade?) is hell.

I'm going insane. My memory is full of holes, I'm trapped in my own body, acting
on its own. The rooms change. I love Haquim, but it is a false sort of love.

I have forgotten the face of my mother.

He had a man delivered yesterday, he spoke a word, and I killed the man. He fought
back, I was better.

I've never been in a fight. At least not that I remember.

Today I tried to kick high like I remember doing. I fell on my ass.

Were my horns always red? I can't remember.

Haquim sits in the corner and takes notes; this I know. He always does.

----

The following month(? Year? Decade?) is heaven.

I clean and cook for him. When he is amorous I share his bed.

_Haq---_


----

I smash a plate. He gives me four strikes with a flexible cane as punishment,
and forces himself upon me.

----

_---uim._

He tells me things about magic and I listen and smile and nod and call him clever.

This is what I want. I get to eat, I get to wear fine clothes.

----

A man comes for a visit. He's handsome, but not as handsome as Haquim. He 
has a woman with him, who is prettier than me by far, and Haquim looks at her
appreciatively.

I hate it.

The man looks at me and winks. I don't know what that means.

----

My belly swells. The handsome man returns; Malek, is his name. Haquim and he
discuss magic at length. They stay for dinner.

Haquim banishes me from the bedchambers that night.

I cry myself to sleep.

In the morning I find a note under my pillow. It reads:

_He doesn't love you. He never did. And I brought him a better toy._

----

The woman keeps coming back. I keep getting banished from the bedchamber each night.
He still cares for me, but it isn't the same.

I have full access to his lab. I put a few droplets of milk of the poppy in his cocoa.

Once he is sleeping soundly, I knock on the bedroom door.

The woman opens. She's wearing a negligee. "Haquim is asleep, can I help you?"

"Yes," I say. "It's the baby; I--- I'm not as nimble as I were, and I dropped the keys
to the pantry under the kitchen counter."

She smiles. "Of course. I'll help."

We go into the kitchen and she bends down to reach under the counter. I unsheathe my knife and
plunge it into her back, right under her ribs where I know the kidney sits. She slumps over almost
immediately with a rattle.

I roll her over and slit her throat like I usually slaughter goats. I even put a bowl under her
trhoat to collect the blood.

Quickly I return to the master bedchamber and enter as quietly as I can muster.

Haquim hasn't moved at all. With all the delicate care I have in me, I tie his fingers together with
string so he can't gesture, and his hands to the bedposts. I put a piece of rope in his mouth so he'll be unable
to incant.

Then I take the pillow and put it over his head.

----

The magical knapsack my back is full of stolen books and provisions. I steal through the lower warrens of
the city to a small lodging by the docks, and rent a room there.

I cry myself to sleep, but not out of sorrow for the deaths; out of sorrow for the fact that I've killed
and feel nothing.

----

It's a week hence that I give birth. A kindly fishmonger's wife finds me
wandering the piers in labor, and takes me in; she is my midwife. It's a baby boy
with red skin.

I don't love him one bit. I cry and pretend it's happiness as I swaddle the
offspring of the man who so thoroughly violated my mind and flesh for years and
years.

As soon as I can, I leave.

I leave town, across the piers in the marshland, onto the steppes. It's
not easy to travel with an infant, but I make do. Only once am three days away, beyond
the maize fields, well into the scrublands where cattle grazes, I
stray from the beaten path, entering the wilderness; headed for the Old Rocks.

In one of the books I've brought with me lies a dark ritual, and in the knapsack
the components for it.

With grim resolution, ignoring the cries of the little one which that--- that _beast_ of
a man _Haquim_ put in me, I draw up the heptagram, spill the fresh ashes, and incant.

There's a column of hellfire, and out of it dances a feminine figure. All
legs and curves and black carapace, clad in a tailored tunic of grey silk that
leaves nothing to the imagination. Her eight eyes are deep pits that threaten to
swallow me up.

"_Why hello, what have we here?_"

She casually steps over the bounds of the diagram, and a shiver runs down my spine.

"I--- I want power. I have gifts."

"_Oho?_"

Taking a deep breath, I turn around and pick up the swaddled newborn. He smells like shit, having
soiled himself again. "My firstborn."

"_Huh. That's_ Fey. _How unusual. But you're fire-born, girl. Anyway, gift horses._"

She snaps her fingers, and my arms are empty. There's a hollow pang in my chest of
feelings I am supposed to have but do not.

"_More._"

"Uh, I..." scrambling for another sacrifice,
I upend my knapsack --- it's a useful, if common, magic item. "This?"

She snaps her fingers again. "_Hum. Anything else?_"

I dig through the pile of things, and find Haquim's personalized spell book --- the one
he kept on him at all times. Another snap, another void suddenly between my hands.

"_All right, that's enough of trinkets. I want someting personal._"

My mental gears grind. "Take my womb," I say without hesitation.

They cock their head to one side. "_You're very willing to part with it. That discounts it
somewhat._"

This time, I almost collapse from the pain. A void opens up in my guts, and I keel over,
nauseous beyond measure.

"_Anything else, snow-white?_"

I rack my addled mind for something. "You. Can. Have. My---" I gag "_name._" Haquim only
ever called me 'pet' --- Jacaranda was what my mother called me.

They kneel over me. "_Jacaranda... Your mother gave you that... Why not; I'll take it._"

I dry heave once, curling up in the foetal position.
Though watering eyes, I see her smile. She snaps her fingers once more, and I don't feel any
change.

"_Now, you of course know the conditions of this pact, no? Once you die, your sorry soul is mine._"

I close my eyes.

"_And if you want to get on my good side... Girl, you gotta be spectacular. I'll be in touch---
oh, and: this will be our little secret, yeah?_"

----

Clapping. Clap. Clap. Clap.

I open my eyes and see him. That man who came to see Haquim.

"Splendid work, little Warlock."

As quickly as I can, I spring to my feet, knife drawn. It is
not that quick.

"I'm a friend," he says.
"I killed your lady friend with this knife," I say.

He chuckles. "Oh, she's far from dead; it was all part of the plan to
get Haquim out of our way. That you managed to fuck up _this_ much is
just icing on the cake."

My eyes narrow. "What do you mean?"

"Haquim was a thorn in the side of my cause. Lecherous, powerful,
undyingly loyal to the powers that be, and posessed of a particularly
nasty skill-set. Having him dead makes it _far_ easier to maneuver."

"I don't care for your cause," I say. "Leave me alone."

His smile fades. "They will be coming for you," he says. He drops a
bundle of cloth on the ground. "Summoning Archfiends --- even just
avatars --- is frowned upon by the Church of the Five."

Then he's gone.

I unwrap the bundle, finding it to be a cloak wrapped around a
set of adventuring gear.
