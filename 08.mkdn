Sleep doesn't come, which is odd, since I should be bone-deep tired.

I toss and turn in the luxurious bed, and eventually resolve to do something
productive instead. The ritual book with the four rituals I couldn't decipher
a few days ago, now seems more easily legilible: two of the five stand out to my
increased acumen.
