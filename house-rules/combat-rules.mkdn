## Parallel Concentration

Concentration is a limited resource. Being able to only concentrate on one spell
is limiting, and having attacks break concentration renders casters vulnerable.

But the idea that the difference between a 20th level Wizard and a 1st level Wizard is
only in how hard to break their concentration, is a little ridiculous.

The more powerful a spellcaster becomes, the more spells they are capable of concentrating
on. The number of spells they can concentrate on, is dependent on their
_tier_ of play.

##### Play Tiers
| Level | Tier |
|:-----:|:----:|
| 1–4   | 1    |
| 5–10  | 2    |
| 11–16 | 3    |
| 17–20 | 4    |

For most casters, the number of spells they can maintain concentration on is
equal to their tier. For Rangers and Paladins, the number is _half_ their tier,
rounded up. For Arcane Tricksters and Eldrich Knights, the number is _one
third_ of their tier, rounded up.

> ##### Stacking Spells
>
> For the most part, casting the same concentration spell twice on a target
> does not confer additional benefits.

If a caster concentrating on multiple spells is hit by an attack, and fail their
Constitution save to maintain concentration, they loose concentration on _all_ spells.

## Power Attacks and Called Shots

When making an attack with a weapon you are proficient with,
you can choose to forego adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll
in favor of adding it to the damage roll instead.

Under certain circumstances, you may instead add _twice_ your proficiency bonus to damage:

- When attacking with a martial weapon in general
- Barbarians, Fighters, Rangers, Paladins, Valor College Bards, and War Domain Clerics when attacking
  with simple weapons
- Monks when attacking unarmed or with monk weapons
- Rogues when attacking with finesse weapons
- Warlocks when attacking with their blade pact weapon
- Druids when Wildshaped
- When attacking with a weapon covered by a “weapon mastery” feat such as _great weapon master_

This rule can also be applied to a shove maneuver: as normal, the attack roll doesn't
have proficiency bonus; instead the shoved creature moves 10 feet rather than 5 feet.

If you can attack multiple times as part of your attack maneuver, such as with the Extra Attack
class feature, you may forego one or more of your extra attacks. If you
do so, you may add your proficiency bonus once more to any remaining attack, for each attack you
forego.

This extra proficiency bonus can be subtracted for use with the power attack rule, but only
once per attack.

> ##### Called Shot
>
> A power attack with a melee weapon is of course a reckless swing or lunge
> focusing more on force behind the blow than striking the opening in the
> enemy's defences.
>
> But you cannot simply draw a bow harder — the bow after all is only as
> strong as its maximum draw weight. Instead, a ranged ‘power attack’ is a called
> shot aimed at a vulnerable area.
